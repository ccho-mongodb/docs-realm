   :class: singlecol

Overview
--------

You can query data stored in MongoDB directly from your client
application code using the :js-sdk:`RemoteMongoDB
<Realm-RemoteMongoDB.html>` service. {+service-short+} provides data
access :ref:`rules <mongodb-rules>` for collections to securely retrieve
results based on the logged-in user or the content of each document.


Prerequisites
-------------

Before you can remotely access MongoDB, you must:

- Have a :term:`linked Atlas cluster <linked cluster>` 


Example: Query For Data in Your Collection
------------------------------------------

The following example is an HTML file. After setting your {+app+} ID
in the code, you can open the file in a browser and check the console to
see the output of the findOne() operation or any errors.

.. note::

   The following code snippet requires that :ref:`Anonymous
   Authentication <anonymous-authentication>` is enabled in your MongoDB
   Realm App.
